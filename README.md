# SudoCraft
This is a prototype game that I am creating.
At this moment in time it is supposed to be a 2D dungeon crawler Minecrfat type game.

# Compiling
To compile the current source files, run g++ -Wall -o EXECUTABLE_FILE_NAME_GOES_HERE SudoCraft/source/Game.cpp
Where EXECUTABLE_FILE_NAME is the output of the compiler.

# Running
In the command line, goto the directory that the output of the comiler is stored and the run ./Game
or substitude Game for whatever filename you specified for the compiler(g++) It should be whatever you
put in place of EXECUTABLE_FILE_NAME_GOES_HERE.
