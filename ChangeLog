					Fixed problem with cross compatibility
					with Linux g++ and Windows Visual
					Studio's MSBuild
					* src/Craft.cpp (itemlist) : Changed
					from ```int itemlist[num1][0x02];```

					.NET framework does not allow use of
					```int itemlist[num1][0x02]```
					variable length arrays as it is not in
					standard C++, GNU gcc allows such as
					an extention but MSBuild will not
					compile.
